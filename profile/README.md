# Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL)

The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) initiative is motivated by the need for a preservation-centric, common approach to filesystem (or cloud / object storage) layout for digital repositories. The goal of this effort is to establish a specified recommendation for such a layout.

This GitHub organization serves as the home for the OCFL's documentation and tooling.

- [Specification](https://github.com/OCFL/spec) (published to https://ocfl.io)
- [Specification extensions](https://github.com/OCFL/extensions)
- [Meeting notes and wiki](https://github.com/OCFL/spec/wiki)
- [Test fixtures](https://github.com/OCFL/fixtures)
- [Use cases](https://github.com/OCFL/Use-Cases)

Additionally, in support of collaboration and discoverability, we encourage the inclusion of software tooling created by the OCFL community to be minimally linked from the [implementations documentation](https://github.com/OCFL/spec/wiki/Implementations) and potentially hosted in this GitHub organization, as appropriate. 

See [the guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CboNeHVv7DF0HsbLIJoracKAYa40hGV-gofpYK6XIg/edit?usp=sharing) regarding how to create and manage an OCFL-related project (i.e. "contributed project") on this GitHub organization.
